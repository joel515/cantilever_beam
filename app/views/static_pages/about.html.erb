<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  This rails application is intended to be a proof-of-concept <em>Sim App</em>
  that performs a simple rectangular cross section end- and gravity-loaded
  cantilever beam finite element analysis based on the following user input:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spacial dimensions (length, width, and height)</li>
  <li>Material properties (elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density)</li>
  <li>End load</li>
  <li>Mesh size</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The app is intended to be a problem-specific front end for Elmer. It utilizes
  GMSH for geometry and mesh generation, ElmerGrid for mesh conversion, and
  ElmerSolver for the analysis computation.
</p>
<p>
  Results will be presented quantitatively and as a percent error from
  hand-calculated values. Future implementations will include a web-based
  Paraview user interface.
